This is a flashcard app with barely enough features to pass as one. More features coming when I feel like it.

I am not planning to release this app to either the Google Play Store or the App Store; I am too poor for that. However, you can build the app yourself if you really want to, or if you use Android, download the .apk from the Releases.
